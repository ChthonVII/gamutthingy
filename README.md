# gamutthingy


**NOTE:** This readme file is in the middle of a substantial revision. The section explaining parameters has been fully revised; the rest has not.

Performs color gamut conversion conversion with chromatic adaptation and gamut compression mapping, and optionally simulates the "color correction" behavior of several CRT televisions.

Principally intended for adjusting the colors of CRT-era games for modern sRGB displays.

Four general modes of operation:
- Convert a single color input and print the result to the console.
- Convert a .png image input and save the output to a .png image.
- Generate a 3D lookup table (LUT) and save the output to a .png image.
- Simulate the color palette of a NES/Famicom and save the output to a .pal file in the format used by most NES emulators.

#### Parameters
**Input Modes:**
- `--color` or `-c`: Specifies a single color to convert. Should be a "0x" prefixed hexadecimal representation of an RGB8 color. For example: `0xFABF00`.  A message containing the result will be printed to stdout.
- `--infile` or `-i`: Specifies an input file to convert. Should be a .png image. Output will be saved to the output file specified with `-o` or `--outfile`.
- `--lutgen`: Generate a LUT. Possible values are `true` or `false`(default). Output will be saved to the output file specified with `-o` or `--outfile`.
- `--nespalgen`: Generate a NES/Famicom palette. Possible values are `true` or `false`(default). Output will be saved to the output file specified with `-o` or `--outfile`.

**Input-Related Parameters:**
- `--gamma-in` or `--gin`: Specifies the gamma function to be applied to the input. Possible values are `srgb` (default), `linear`, and `rec2084`. Will be ignored if CRT simulation before gamut conversion is enabled (`--crtemu front`) since the CRT EOTF function will be used instead. (Note that `rec2084` is not very useful since 16-bit png input isn't supported yet.)
- `--hdr-sdr-max-nits` or `--hsmn`: See same in "Output Parameters," below.
- `--lutsize`: Specifies the size of the LUT to generate. E.g., `--lutsize 64` will result in a 64x64x64 LUT. Integer number. Default 128.
- `--eilut`: Enables "Expanded Intermediate LUT Generation" mode. LUTs generated with this mode assume that the program using the LUT performs its own composite and color correction simulation, and then shifts and renormalizes the output from the range specified by `--crtclamplow` and `--crtclamphigh` to 0-1. (CRT color correction usually produces out-of-bounds values that need to be normalized.) (If `--crtclamphighenable false`, it will be forced to true and the default high clamping value will be used.) This is useful if you want to simulate composite video artifacts that cannot be expressed by simply changing the R'G'B' input value. Because gamutthingy prunes the source gamut boundaries based on the color correction simulation, the program using the LUT needs to implement substantially similar color correction simulation. (An alternative approach would be to apply the inverse of the color correction (expressed as a R'G'B'-to-R'G'B' matrix), then use the LUT generated by the standard mode.) Possible values are `true` or `false`(default).
- `--nespalmode`: When generating NES palette, simulate a PAL NES model instead of a NTSC one. Possible values are `true` or `false`(default).
- `--nesburstnorm`: When generating NES palette, normalize chroma to the amplitude of the NES's colorburst, rather than assuming 40 IRE. While CRT televisions should do this, in practice some did and some didn't. Possible values are `true`(default) or `false`.
- `--nesskew26a`: When generating NES palette, phase skew, in degrees, caused by design of the traces for hues \#2, \#6, and \#A. Floating point number. Default 4.5.
- `--nesboost48c`: When generating NES palette, luma boost, in IRE units, caused by design of the traces for hues \#4, \#8, and \#C. Floating point number. Default 1.0.
- `--nesperlumaskew`: When generating NES palette, phase skew, in degrees, for each step of increasing luma. Floating point number. Default -2.5. Sane values are -2.5 for the 2C02E PPU chip used in early NTSC NES/Famicom models, -5.0 for the 2C02G used in mid/late NTSC models, and -10.0 for the 2C07 used in PAL models (although PAL phase alternation cancels this out when `--nespalmode true`).

**CRT Simulation Parameters:**
- `--crtemu`: Specifies whether to simulate a CRT before or after gamut conversion, or not at all. Possible values are `none` (default), `front` (before the gamut conversion), and `back` (after the gamut conversion). The common use case is `front`. There are few, if any, use cases for `back`.
- `--crtmod`: Specifies the R'G'B'-to-composite modulator chip in the game console. Note that (1) on paper, these chips are all extremely close to an ideal modulator, (2) the data sheets for these chips were often more aspirational than descriptive, and (3) these chips generated all sorts of analog artifacts that aren't simulated here. Accordingly, `none` is the advised setting. Possible values are:
     - `none`  Assume an ideal modulator.(default)
     - `CXA1145` Extremely common. Used in most 1st generation and some 2nd generation Sega Genesis, Sega Master System II, NEO GEO AES, Amiga consoles, SNK consoles, and many other things.
     - `CXA1645` Used in some 2nd generation and all 3rd generation Sega Genesis, Sony Playstation 1, Genesis 3, Sega Saturn, NeoGeo CD/CDZ.
- `--crtdemod`: Specifies the composite-to-R'G'B' demodulator chip in the CRT television. CRT "color correction" is accomplished via the demodulation angles and gains built into this chip. Possible values are:
     - `none` Assume an ideal "straight" demodulator. (default)
     - `dummy` Same as `none`. Use this for chips implementing "no color correction" standards such as EBU and SMPTE-C.
     - `CXA1464AS` Used in Japan Sony Trinitron ~1993-1995.
     - `CXA1465AS` Used in U.S. Sony Trinitron ~1993-1995.
     - `CXA1870S_JP` Used in Japan Sony Trinitron ~1996.
     - `CXA1870S_US` Used in U.S. Sony Trinitron ~1996.
     - `CXA2060BS_JP` Likely used in Japan Sony Trinitron ~1997.
     - `CXA2060BS_US` Likely used in U.S. Sony Trinitron ~1997.
     - `CXA2060BS_PAL` Likely used in Europe Sony Trinitron ~1997.
     - `CXA2025AS_JP` Used in Japan Sony Trinitron ~1997.
     - `CXA2025AS_US` Used in U.S. Sony Trinitron ~1997.
     - `CXA1213AS` Probably used in Sony Trinitron ~1992. Unclear if this chip was meant for Japan, U.S., or both.
     - `TDA8362` Used in Hitachi CMT2187/2196/2198/2199 ~1994. Unclear if this television used different whitepoints in U.S. and Japan.
- `--crtdemodfixes`: Specificies whether to assume low-precision values for demodulator angles and gains that are near "straight" demodulation were intended to mean "straight" demodulation and automatically correct them to exact values. Possible values are `true` (default) or `false`.
- `--crtdemodrenorm`: Specifies the conditions for renormalizing demodulator gains. Possible values are `none` (never renormalize), `insane` (only if both the B-Y angle is non-zero and the B-Y gain is non-one)(default), `nonzeroangle` (if the B-Y angle is non-zero), `gainnot1` (if the B-Y gain is non-one), or `all` (if either B-Y angle is non-zero or the B-Y gain is non-one). Presently, CXA1213AS and TDA8362 are the only implemented demodulators that meet any of these criteria. CXA1213AS seems to give better results without renormalization, while TDA8362 gives better results with it. Hence the default.
- `--crtyuvconst`: Set the precision for the white balance constants used in demodulation equations. Possible values are `2digit` (truncated constants from 1953 standard), `3digit` (less truncated constants from 1994 SMPTE-C (170M) standard)(default), or `exact` (compute precise constants from 1953 primaries and Illuminant C).
- `--crtclamplow`: Specifies low clamping level for out-of-bounds R'G'B' output from demodulation. Floating point number -0.1 to 0. Default -0.1.
- `--crtclamphighenable`: Specifies whether to clamp high out-of-bounds R'G'B' output from demodulation. Possible values are `true` (default) or `false`.
- `--crtclamphigh`: Specifies high clamping level for out-of-bounds R'G'B' output from demodulation. Floating point number >= 1.0. Default 1.1. Sane values are 1.0 to 1.2, particularly 1.0, 1.04, and 1.1. Does nothing unless `--crtclamphighenable true`.
- `--crtblack`: Specifies black level for CRT EOTF function in 100x cd/m^2. Floating point number. Default 0.0001. Sane values are 0.0001 to 0.001 (0.01 to 0.1 cd/m^2). The default is probably close to a properly calibrated Sony Trinitron. [insert cite]
- `--crtwhite`: Specifies white level for CRT EOTF function in 100x cd/m^2. Floating point number. Default 1.71. Sane values for aperature grille CRTs are around 1.8 (180 cd/m^2). The default is probably close to a properly calibrated Sony Trinitron. [insert cite] Shadow mask CRTs were substantially dimmer. Professional-grade televisions may have aimed for 100 cd/m^s because that was the standard.

     - `trinitron_d65_soniera` Measured whitepoint of a Sony Trinitron PVM-20L5 professional-grade CRT television (model launched 2002). See [insert cite]. 6480K, near D65.
     - `diamondpro_d65_fairchild` Measured whitepoint of a Mitsubishi Diamond Pro (unspecified model number) computer monitor with Trinitron tube in D65 mode. See [insert cite]. Rather far off D65.
     - `diamondpro_93k_fairchild` Measured whitepoint of a Mitsubishi Diamond Pro (unspecified model number) computer monitor with Trinitron tube in 9300K mode. See [insert cite]. Near 9300K+27mpcd.

     - `customcoord` Use the coordinants supplied by the user via `--source-whitepoint-custom-coords`.
     - `customtemp` Derive coordinants from color temperature supplied by user via `--source-whitepoint-custom-temp`.
- `--source-whitepoint-custom-coords` or `--swcc`: Specify the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates for the whitepoint of the source gamut as a comma-separated list (no spaces!) in x,y order. For example: `0.281,0.311`. Does nothing unless `--source-whitepoint customcoord`.
- `--source-whitepoint-custom-temp` or `--swct`: Specify color temperature for the whitepoint of the source gamut, and coordinates will be estimated automatically. Floating point number. Does nothing unless `--source-whitepoint customtemp`.
- `--dest-primaries` or `-d`: Specifies the color primaries of the destination gamut. Possible values are the same as for source gamut. Default is `srgb_spec`.
- `--dest-primaries-custom-coords` or `-dpcc`: Specify the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates for the color primaries of the destination gamut as a comma-separated list (no spaces!) in the following order: redx,redy,greenx,greeny,bluex,bluey. For example: `0.621,0.34,0.281,0.606,0.152,0.067`. Does nothing unless `--dest-primaries customcoord`.
- `--dest-whitepoint` or `--dw`: Specifies the whitepoint of the destination gamut. Possible values are the same as for `--source-whitepoint`. Default `D65`.
- `--dest-whitepoint-custom-coords` or `--dwcc`: Specify the CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates for the whitepoint of the destination gamut as a comma-separated list (no spaces!) in x,y order. For example: `0.281,0.311`. Does nothing unless `--dest-whitepoint customcoord`.
- `--dest-whitepoint-custom-temp` or `--dwct`: Specify color temperature for the whitepoint of the destination gamut, and coordinates will be estimated automatically. Floating point number. Does nothing unless `--dest-whitepoint customtemp`.

**Chromatic Adaptation Parameters:**
- `--adapt` or `-a`: Specifies the chromatic adaptation method to use when changing whitepoints. Possible values are `cat16` (default) or `bradford`.

**Spiral CARISMA Parameters:**
- `--spiral-carisma` or `--sc`: Perform selective hue rotation on certain high-saturation colors prior to gamut compression. Possible values are `true` (default) or `false`. Automatically disabled for NES palette generation.
- `--scfunction` or `--scf`: Interpolation function to use for Spiral CARISMA. Possible values are `cubichermite` (default) or `exponential`.
- `--scfloor` or `--scfl`: Specify the floor for the interpolation function used by Spiral CARISMA on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 relative to the saturation of the cusp at any given hue. Colors less saturated than this will not be rotated at all. Floating point number. Default 0.7.
- `--scceiling` or `--sccl`: Specify the ceiling for the interpolation function used by Spiral CARISMA on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 relative to the saturation of the cusp at any given hue. Colors more saturated than this will receive full rotation. Floating point number. Default 1.0.
- `--scexponent` or `--scxp`: Specify the exponent to use when Spiral CARISMA is configured to use an exponential function for interpolation (`--scfunction exponential`). Floating point number. 1.0 is linear. Values less than 1.0 are not recommended. Default 1.2.
- `--scmax` or `--scm`: Specify scaling factor applied to Spiral CARISMA's max rotation. Floating point number. 1.0 is full strength. 0.0 effectively disables Spiral CARISMA. Default 1.0.

**Gamut Compression Parameters:**
- `--map-mode` or `-m`: Specifies gamut mapping mode. Possible values are:
     - `clip`: No gamut mapping is performed and linear RGB output is simply clipped to 0, 1. Hue will be altered and detail in the out-of-bounds range will be lost. Not recommended.
     - `compress`: Uses a gamut (compression) mapping algorithm to remap out-of-bounds colors to a smaller zone inside the gamut boundary. Also remaps colors originally in that zone to make room. Essentially trades away some colorimetric fidelity in exchange for preserving hue and some of the out-of-bounds detail. Default.
     - `expand`: Same as `compress` but also applies the inverse of the compression function in directions where the destination gamut boundary exceeds the source gamut boundary. (Also, reverses the order of the steps in the `vp`, `vpr`, and `vprc` algorithms.) The only use for this is to prepare an image for a "roundtrip" conversion. Does not work well with CRT simulation. In the future, I plan to deprecate this mode in favor of a flow-blown inverse color search mode.
- `--gamut-mapping-algorithm` or `--gma`: Specifies which gamut mapping algorithm to use. (Does nothing if `--map-mode clip`.) Possible values are:
     - `cusp`: The CUSP algorithm decribed in [1], but with tunable compression parameters discussed below.
     - `hlpcm`: The HLPCM algorithm described in [2], but with tunable compression parameters discussed below.
     - `vp`: The VP algorithm described in [3], but with linear light scaling and tunable compression parameters discussed below.
     - `vpr`: VPR, a modification of the VP algorithm created for gamutthingy. The modifications are discussed below.
     - `vprc`: VPRC, a further modification of the VP algorithm created for gamutthingy. The modifications are discussed below. Default.
- `--safe-zone-type` or `-z`: Specifies how the outer zone subject to remapping and the inner "safe zone" exempt from remapping are defined. Possible values are:
     - `const-fidelity`: The standard approach in which the zones are defined relative to the distance from the "center of gravity" to the destination gamut boundary. Yields consistent colorimetric fidelity, with variable detail preservation.
     - `const-detail`: The approach described in [4] in which the remapping zone is defined relative to the difference between the distances from the "center of gravity" to the source and destination gamut boundaries. As implemented here, an overriding minimum size for the "safe zone" (relative to the destination gamut boundary) may also be enforced. Yields consistent detail preservation, with variable colorimetric fidelity (setting aside the override option).  Default.
     - Note that the behavior when `--safe-zone-type const-detail` is used in conjunction with a high minimum safe zone set by `--remap-limit` is somewhat unintuitive. This mode will never preserve more detail than `--safe-zone-type const-fidelity` with the same limit. Rather it will sometimes preserve less detail, in exchange for greater colorimetric fidelity, where the gamut boundary differences are small and presumably "enough" detail is already preserved.
- `--remap-factor` or `--rf`: Specifies the size of the remapping zone relative to the difference between the distances from the "center of gravity" to the source and destination gamut boundaries. (Does nothing if `--safe-zone-type const-fidelity`.) Floating point number 0.0 to 1.0. Default 0.4.
- `--remap-limit` or `--rl`: Specifies the size of the safe zone (exempt from remapping) relative to the distance from the "center of gravity" to the destination gamut boundary. If `--safe-zone-type const-detail`, this serves as a minimum size limit when application of `--remap-factor` would lead to a smaller safe zone. Floating point number 0.0 to 1.0.  Default 0.9.
- `--knee` or `-k`: Specifies the type of knee function used for compression, `hard` or `soft` (default).
- `--knee-factor` or `--kf`: Specifies the width of the soft knee relative to the size of the remapping zone. (Does nothing if `--knee hard`.) Note that the soft knee is centered at the knee point, so half the width extends into the safe zone, thus expanding the area that is remapped. Floating point number 0.0 to 1.0. Default 0.4.

**Output Parameters:**
- `--outfile` or `-o`: Specifies output file. For .png file conversion and LUT generation, the output will be a .png file. For NES palette generation, the output will be a .pal file usable by most NES emulators.
- `--neshtmloutputfile`: Specifies a secondary output file for writing a NES palette in human-readable html.
- `--gamma-out` or `--gout`: Specifies the inverse gamma function to be applied to the output. Possible values are `srgb` (default), `linear`, and `rec2084`. Will be ignored if CRT simulation after gamut conversion is enabled (`--crtemu back`) since the CRT inverse EOTF function will be used instead. (Note that `rec2084` is not very useful since 16-bit png output isn't supported yet.)
- `--hdr-sdr-max-nits` or `--hsmn`: Specific max nits used to display SDR white on a HDR monitor for rec2084 gamma. Floating point number. Default 200.0. Sane values are ~150 to ~200. This should be documented in your monitor's user manual. Google Chrome defaults to 200 if autodetection fails [insert cite].
- `--dither` or `--di`: Specifies whether to apply dithering to the output. Possible values are `true` (default) or `false`. Uses Martin Roberts' quasirandom dithering algorithm described in [5]. Automatically disabled for single-color input, LUT generation, and NES palette generation.

**Misc Parameters:**
- `--help` or `-h`: Displays help.
- `--verbosity` or `-v`: Specify verbosity level. Integer numbers 0-5. Default 2.

#### Usage Tips
- Destination primaries and whitepoint should generally be sRGB spec and D65. (Unless you're trying to prepare something for roundtrip conversion.)
- There are two general approaches to color grading CRT-era games: Matching a television you personally used to own, or matching a television similar to what the graphic artist used when making the game. In the latter case, you generally need to know when the game was developed and in what country.
     - **Japan:** P22 phosphors, whitepoint near 9300K, color correction via Japan mode/model demodulator chip. Some example combinations that look plausible in practice:
          - `--source-primaries P22_trinitron --source-whitepoint 9300K27mpcd --crtemu front --crtdemod CXA1464AS`
          - `--source-primaries P22_trinitron_mixandmatch --source-whitepoint 9300K8mpcd --crtemu front --crtdemod CXA2060BS_JP`
	- **U.S.:** The SMPTE-C 170M standard was issued in 1994, but adoption was not instantaneous. Many (most?) mid-90s CRT televisions still had color correction suitable for broadcasts using the old standard. For games made by U.S. developers from 1994 to 2000ish, you may have to try both possibilities and see which looks more plausible.
	     - Old standard: P22 phosphors, whitepoint near D65, color correction via U.S. mode/model demodulator chip. Some example combinations that look plausible in practice:
	          - `--source-primaries P22_trinitron_mixandmatch --source-whitepoint 7100K --crtemu front --crtdemod CXA2060BS_US`
	          - TODO: Another good looking US example
        - New standard: P22 phosphors, whitepoint near D65, no color correction. For expensive/professional models, SPMTE-C spec phosphors, whitepoint exactly D65, no color correction.
   - **Europe/Australia:** P22 phosphors, whitepoint near D65, no color correction. For expensive/professional models, EBU spec phosphors, whitepoint exactly D65, no color correction. Plausible looking example:
        - `--source-primaries ebu_spec --source-whitepoint D65 --crtemu front --crtdemod dummy`
- Unfortunately, while we have several data points in the categories of phosphor chromaticities, whitepoint chromaticity, and color correction behavior, we do not have any cases where we can say with certainty that a particular trio of phosphors, whitepoint, and color correction were used together in a particular model of television. So you will have to guess. Yellow is most strongly impacted by color correction behavior. If you can find a combination where yellows are neither too orange nor too green, then everything else will probably look good too. Some hints for calibrating around yellow:
     - Toggle Spiral CARISMA. Generally Spiral CARISMA makes primary/secondary colors look better, but occasionally things look better without it.
     - Lower whitepoint temperature makes yellows oranger; higher whitepoint temperature makes them greener.
     - Clipping demodulator output closer to 1.0 makes yellows oranger; clipping higher or not clipping at all makes them greener. (Clipping lower also makes red darker but more saturated, and reduces red-on-red detail.)
     - Try a different demodulator. You can see the angles and gains by looking in the source code in constants.h. Larger red and green angles make yellows oranger; smaller angles make them greener. Red and green gains have proportionate effects, obviously.
     - Some combinations simply do not work. Each demodulator chip was intended to pair with a particular set of phosphors (and whitepoint). If you try use certain phosphors with a demodulator intended for very different phosphors, there may be no set of parameters that look good.
     - Some combinations may be missing pieces. Each demodulator chip was intended to pair with a particular set of phosphors (and whitepoint). But there is no guarantee that both the phosphors and demodulator are represented here.
- To compute hardcoded colors for things like FFNX hext files and mark.dat in FFNx's NTSC-J mode use `--color` to convert a single color.
- LUT generation while simulating a CRT can only produces LUTs that use R'G'B' input. The program using the LUT must perform linearization in order to compute correct weights for interpolating between the 8 nearest lookup values.
- When generating a LUT, you may wish to use sRGB output gamma so that more bandwidth is dedicated to darker colors. (Dark blue, in particular, tends to develop artifacts if starved of bandwidth.) However, if you do so, then the program using the LUT must linearize the lookup values before interpolating between them.
- Unfortunately, Retroarch does not support 256x256x256 LUTs. 128x128x128 works though.

#### Implementation Details:

**Gamut Operations:**
- When converting between gamuts with different white points, chromatic adaptation is done via the the "CAT16" method described in [10] or the "Bradford method" described in [6] (see also [7]). CAT16 is the default.
- Gamut mapping operations are done in the JzCzhz colorspace, the polar cousin to Jzazbz, described in [8]. A couple notes on JzCzhz:
     - Scaling the units of the XYZ input to set the absolute brightness causes the hue angles to rotate. Most of this rotation happens at very low brightness. For example, linear RGB red (1,0,0) rotates about 10 degrees going from 1 nit to 100 nits, but only about 1 degree going from 100 nits to 10,000 nits. I don't know if this is just a flaw in Jzazbz's design or an accurate depiction of some brightness-hue interaction like the Bezold–Brücke shift, or something else entirely. In part to avoid any problems here, everything is scaled to 200 nits.
     - The inverse PQ function used in Jzazbz -> XYZ conversion can sometimes produce NAN outputs. Without doing a formal analysis and proof, I *assume* this is *always* the result of asking pow() to do something that leads to an imaginary or complex number, and *only* happens on inputs that fall outside any possible gamut.
- Gamut boundaries are sampled as described in [9]. Hue is sampled in 0.2 degree slices. For the coarse sampling phase, luminance is sampled in 30 steps from black to white, and chroma is sampled in 50 steps from neutral to 110% of the highest chroma value found among the red, green, and blue points. For the fine sampling phase, luminance is sampled in 50 steps and chroma is sampled in 20 steps between coarse samples. To find the boundary in a given direction, the boundary in each of the adjacent sampled hue slices is found via 2D line-line intersection, then extrapolated for the input hue via 3D line-plane intersection. To find the luminance of the cusp at a given hue, the weighted average of the cusp luminance of the adjacent sampled hue slices is used.
- Five gamut mapping algorithms are available:
    - CUSP, described in [1].
    - Hue Lightness Preserving Chroma Mapping (HLPCM), described in [2]. (Note that this algorithm has been around under various names since at least the 1990s.)
    - Vividness-Preserved (VP), described in [3].
    - Vividness-Preserved, Reversed Steps (VPR), a modification of VP created for gamutthingy. The modifications are discussed below.
    - Vividness-Preserved, Reversed Steps, CUSP (VPRC), a further modification of VP created for gamutthingy. The modifications are discussed below.
- Linear lightness scaling is always used. This is why CUSP is used instead of its successors GCUSP or SGCK. HLPCM starts from the assumption that lightness scaling is either not needed or already done. VP has a complex lightness scaling step that is replaced here with simple linear scaling. There are four reasons for this: First, we simply don't have one good value for the typical brightness of the devices in our core use cases. Consumer television and PC monitor manufacturers generally ignore the specs and seek to offer as much brightness as possible. Thus maximum brightness varies between manufacturers and models (particularly between aperature grille and shadow mask), and is very rarely documented. (For instance, [wikipedia's article on comparing display technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_plasma,_and_OLED_displays) cites only one single test of one single CRT television.) Second, to the extent we have to make a guess, the maximum brightness of late-90s CRT televisions, modern SDR monitors, and modern HDR monitors in SDR mode are (very) roughly in the same neighborhood -- around 200 nits. Third, to the extent we have to make a guess, late-90s CRT televisions were probably slightly dimmer than modern monitors, leading to the situation for our main use case (NTSC-J and sRGB) where the dimmer gamut is the wider one. This is the reverse of what's expected in all the literature, and tends to undermine the rationales for various lightness scaling regimes. Fourth, I'm uneasy about working in Jzazbz on inputs of differing max lightness. (See above.) For all these reasons, lightness is simply scaled to 200 nits for the white point.
- The compression function is tunable. It's possible to move the knee point, use a hard or soft knee with a tunable width, or to use the unique approach to zone definition from [4]. Typically the outer zone subject to remapping and the inner "safe zone" exempt from remapping are defined relative to the distance from the "center of gravity" to the destination gamut boundary, but [4] defines them relative to the difference between the distances from the "center of gravity" to the source and destination gamut boundaries. In this mode, an overriding minimum size for the "safe zone" can also be set. CUSP does not seem to benefit from [4]'s approach, but the other GMAs appear to. A soft knee seems intuitively superior to a hard knee, but it often makes little difference in practice when quantizing to RGB8 in the end anyway.
- The VP paper is unclear about whether the third step is applied generally or only to below-the-cusp colors. Both possibilites are slightly problematic: If this step is applied across the entire lightness range, some above-the-cusp colors are unnecessarily desaturated. Colors in the remapping zone are pulled back from the boundary, but there are no out-of-bounds colors to fill in the space thus vacated (because step two pulled them all below the cusp). On the other hand, if step three is applied only to below-the-cusp colors, it causes a discontinuity at the cusp's luminosity where funny stuff may happen, possibly including inversion of relative chroma between formerly adjacent colors. Since it seems the slightly more plausible interpretation, gamutthingy applies the third step below the cusp only. VPR was devised as a solution to this problem.
- VPR solves the problem with VP's third step by reversing the order of the second and third steps, with some modifications to the new second step. In preparation for VPR's second step, a temporary working gamut boundary is constructed for each gamut by discarding the above-the-cusp boundary segments and replacing them with a segment starting at the cusp, going in the direction away from the black point, to somewhere up above the maximum luminosity. VPR's second step does chroma-only compression using these working gamut boundaries, similar to VP's third step. VPR's third step does compression towards the black point, identical to VP's second step.
- VPRC is the same as VPR except that, during the second step, below-the-cusp colors are compressed towards a point on the neutral axis with the same luminosity as the cusp (the same as in the CUSP algorithm), rather than chroma-only compression. This results in dark colors that are slightly brighter and more saturated. The rationale for this is twofold: First, the literature is nearly unanimous that copressing dark colors towards a higher luminosity looks better than chroma-only compression. Second, this reduces artifacts in dark blues when bit depth is insufficient (for example if 64x64x64 LUT stores linear RGB values).
- Spiral CARISMA performs selective hue rotation on certain high-saturation colors prior to gamut compression. Generally gamut compression aims for hue constancy. However, there are some circumstances when hue rotation is preferable: First, if the destination gamut is shallow at the hue angle of a primary or secondary color in the source gamut, the compressed primary/secondary color will be disappointingly desaturated. Second, if the destination gamut is rather acute at a primary or secondary color, this will result in an input color near the source primary/secondary color compressing to an output color that is noticeably more saturated than the output for the source primary/secondary color. (E.g., some "off-red" color ends up redder than red does.) The original CARIMSA algorithm solved these problems by rotating the source gamut's primary and secondary colors towards the destination gamut's. [insert cite] However, this rotation was applied to *everything*, largely undoing the gamut conversion. Spiral CARISMA fixes this by only rotating saturated colors and only when doing so is actually an improvement. The algorithm works as follows:
    - First, the maximum rotation for each primary and secondary color is found by testing possible rotations in small steps from zero to full rotation towards the destination primary/secondary color. For each test rotation, the source primary/secondary color is rotated, then compressed to the destination gamut boundary, and then the distance to the original source primary/secondary color is measured. The rotation leading to the shorst distance is selected. (In practice, the winner is virtually always either zero rotation or full rotation.)
    - Second, the maximum rotation for each hue slice is computed by linear interpolation between the maximum roations of the nearest primary and secondary colors.
    - Third, the rotation to use for a given color is determined by interpolating between zero rotation and the maximum rotation for the hue slice according to the color's saturation relative to the saturation of the cusp in that hue slice. The default interpolation method uses zero rotation below 0.7 relative chroma and a cubic hermite spline from 0.7 to 1.0. Those parameters are tunable, and linear or exponential interpolation can be used instead.
    - Note that Spiral CARISMA necessitates a total recalculation of the source gamut boundaries since the most saturated members of a given hue slice may have rotated away somewhere else, while new colors may have rotated in.
    - If all the primary and secondary colors happen to require rotation in the same direction, the resulting rotations when viewed from above the whitepoint form a spiral. Hence the name.

**General:**
- Dithering is done using Martin Roberts' quasirandom dithering algorithm described in [5].
- PNG plumbing shamelessly borrowed from png2png example by John Cunningham Bowler.
